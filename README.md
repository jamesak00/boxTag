# boxTag

A simple game inspired by a YouTube short that displayed rock, paper, and scissors playing tag. I recreated a simple imitation using red, blue, and green. When a box of a certian colour touches another box, it turns into that colour (red chases green to turn them red, etc).

## Usage

There is an option to turn sound on or off through the global boolean variable "SOUND_ENABLED"
